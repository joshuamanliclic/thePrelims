<h2 style="font-family: Century Gothic; color: blue">Charity Name: Querstadtein Berlin</h2>
<pre style="width: 600px">
querstadtein is the first project of Stadtsichten e.V., a registered non-profit 
association.
Although it is visible everywhere in the city, homelessness is rarely discussed. On a 
theoretical level we often know very little about a topic that confronts us in the 
streets every day. Through querstadtein we would like to raise awareness of this issue.
It all started with the desire of our two founders to get something ‘real’ off the 
ground in Berlin, to actively tackle an issue instead of just thinking about it. Homeless 
people seemed to be everywhere, throughout the city and on the daily commute 
to the office. Some of them were there day in, day out, in the U-Bahn or on the 
street. The divide between the homeless people and the rest of society was striking. 
This is where we wanted to be active – to create a space which would facilitate 
encounters, exchange and awareness.
We would like your help to help the homeless in Berlin.
